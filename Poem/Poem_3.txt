While joy gave clouds the light of stars
That beamed wherâ€™er they looked;
And calves and lambs had tottering knees
And calves and lambs had tottering knees
Excited
While every bird enjoyed his song
Without one thought of harm and wrong
I turned my head and saw the wind
Not far from where I stood
Dragging the corn by her golden hair
Into the dark and lonely wood.
