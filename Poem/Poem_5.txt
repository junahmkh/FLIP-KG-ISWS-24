I am silver and exact. I have no preconceptions.
What ever you see I swallow immediately Just as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.
I am not cruel, only truthfulâ€”
The eye of a little god, four-cornered. 
Most of the time I meditate on the opposite wall. It is pink, with speckles.
I have looked at it so long I think it is a part of my heart.
But it flickers. 
Faces and darkness separate us over and over. 
Now I am a lake.
